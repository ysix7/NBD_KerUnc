# Deep Learning for image deconvolution in the presence of kernel/model uncertainty



This repo provides pre-trained models and the results on benchmark datasets of our CVPR 2020 paper 

[Deep Learning for image deconvolution in the presence of kernel/model uncertainty]: 



## Usage
You should first download the images for test. Please see 
You can use `test.py` to run the test 

## Results on benchmark datasets
Our results contain both synthetic blurry images with kernel error and real images.

For synthetic images, we provide the results with two settings: 
* noise level is 2.55 (1%). Images are generated by "valid convolution" with edge tapper boundary extension.
* noise level is 0 (0%). Images are generated by "same convolution" with periodic extension.
